            "TESS identifies extrasolar planets by watching for dimming events associated with transits, which occur when a planet crosses the face of its host star as seen from Earth. The satellite is also sensitive enough to see occultations — when an orbiting planet passes behind its host star, slightly dimming the total light we receive. ",

            `In 1995, astronomers discovered the first extrasolar planet orbiting a Sun-like star. Ten years later, exoplanet research remained in its infancy. Researchers still weren’t sure whether planets circling other stars were plentiful or rare. So, members of my small satellite research group at MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research opened discussions with our neighbors at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). We pondered how we might repurpose the High Energy Transient Explorer-2 (HETE-2), which we had launched in 2000, to search for signals from extrasolar planets as they passed in front of their host stars.`,
            `We knew that our MIT-built star trackers were capable of detecting changes of as little as 0.1 percent in a star’s brightness. This level of precision would allow us to spot transits of close-in Jupiter-sized planets — so-called hot Jupiters — orbiting solar-type stars. So, in 2005, we proposed to NASA that HETE-2 be assigned a new task and a new name. Rechristened the Hot Exoplanet Transit Experiment-Survey (HETE-S), it would carry out a nearly all-sky survey for transiting hot Jupiters at low cost (approximately $2 million per year) for five years. Unfortunately, NASA declined our proposal, noting that the considerably more capable Kepler Space Telescope — a much larger, $600 million mission dedicated to finding exoplanets by watching them transit their host stars — would soon launch.`,
            `So, HETE-S never came to be. But from its conception was born the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). This mission is the result of more than a decade-long effort, with the primary goal of discovering transiting exoplanets in our solar neighborhood that are ripe for follow-up with the next generation of telescopes.`,

To reach this orbit, TESS underwent a series of three transfer orbits and a lunar flyby, ultimately arriving in its final P/2 orbit 42 days after launch.",

            `Although NASA rejected our proposal for HETE-S, we realized that a small satellite based upon HETE-2 and equipped with newer cameras could come in at a low enough cost for private funding. This new satellite, which we referred to as TESS-P (P for private), could carry out a shallow wide-field survey of the entire sky, complementing Kepler’s 100-square-degree deep narrow-field search by covering a field 400 times greater.`,
            `During 2006 and 2007, the Kavli Foundation, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Google, and a group of MIT departmental and private donors sought funding for TESS. Unfortunately, the Great Recession intervened and the majority of our prospective donors could no longer fund our plan.`,
            `We immediately began planning for the next NASA solicitation, for which proposals were due in 2011. Yet again, NASA selected TESS for a year-long Phase A study, this time as a Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission. We were met with success: TESS was selected and funded as the MIDEX winner in April 2013!`,

          data: [
            `TESS entered development in 2014 with the primary science goal of searching the entire sky for the best 1,000 small exoplanets within 200 light-years — i.e., the solar neighborhood. “Best” in this case means exoplanets with measurable masses, as well as atmospheres that can be studied with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Essentially, TESS would be a finder scope for Webb, scouting for Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting the brightest Sun-like and smaller M-dwarf stars within about 200 light-years of our solar system. TESS would also serve as a bridge from the (now-defunct) Kepler mission to Webb, as well as other large exoplanet imaging space missions with launch dates in the 2030s and beyond.`,
            `The most critical bit of mission planning was selecting an orbit for TESS that would provide a view free of obstacles — namely, Earth. TESS needed to continuously monitor a huge field of view (more than 2,000 square degrees) for weeks at a time. In order to find planets, it would need to see at least two or three transits — and a transit of a small planet might only last one or two hours every couple of weeks. Based on this data collection rate, TESS would also need to downlink enormous numbers of images for ground-based observers to search.              `,
            `Orbits very distant from Earth — like Kepler’s 6.2 million-mile (10 million kilometers) heliocentric orbit or JWST’s planned 900,000-mile (1.5 million km) orbit around the Earth-Sun Lagrange 2 point — seemed desirable. But communicating from those distances would exceed any reasonable budget of antenna time a small mission could expect from NASA’s Deep Space Network.`,
            `The solution turned out to be a new kind of elliptical orbit, in which the satellite spends part of its time close to Earth for data downlink but most of its time at a distance comparable to the Moon’s distance from Earth. Generally, such orbits are notoriously unstable and can result in a spacecraft crashing into either the Moon or Earth within a couple of years. Our unique solution turned out to be an almost magical orbit in a favorable 2:1 resonance with the Moon’s orbit around Earth. Since this specific so-called P/2 orbit had never been used previously in a space mission, our team spent an enormous amount of time analyzing how to establish and maintain it.`,
            `To be sure of our results, we had two different groups — one at The Aerospace Corporation and one at NASA Goddard — work independently on the calculations. In the end, our P/2 orbit was both elegant and practical. It even offered several major advantages, some of which surprised us — especially the excellent thermal stability of our cameras and the low radiation levels experienced by the spacecraft. Other advantages included high downlink rates and low stray background light.`,

          data: [
            `On April 18, 2018, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying TESS roared into space. TESS arrived in its final P/2 orbit 42 days later, and our primary mission’s first survey observation began July 8. Over the next two years, TESS’s four wide-field CCD cameras systematically stepped across the sky. During the first year, TESS observed 13 Southern Hemisphere “sectors” 24° by 96° in size for 27.4 days each. In its second year, TESS switched to observing 13 equally sized sectors in the northern sky.`,
            `The firehose of data from TESS’s first three years has yielded thousands of new planet candidates spread over the entire sky. And the task of identifying the host stars for these candidates has fallen largely upon a small, dedicated group of analysts. Comprising primarily students and postdocs at MIT and the Harvard-Smithsonian CfA, this group — the TESS Objects of Interest (TOI) team — has been working for the past three years, examining light curves for more than 10 million stars brighter than 13th magnitude.
                Their thousands of hours of effort have yielded approximately 3,000 new exoplanet candidates. We estimate that by the middle of this decade, this massive detective effort — which will be assisted by novel artificial intelligence methods currently under development — will have turned up as many as 10,000 new planet candidates. This immense collection should comprise essentially all of the best exoplanet candidates in the solar neighborhood for detailed follow-up and atmospheric characterization.`,
            `The TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP), coordinated by our colleagues at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, is a worldwide effort of more than 550 astronomers at 100 institutions. These researchers sort through and follow up on this rich trove of TOIs using roughly 250 telescopes. TFOP astronomers have whittled down the 3,000 or so TOIs to about 100 so-called Level 1 confirmed TESS exoplanets. These Level 1 planets are all small, with radii less than four times that of Earth. Combined with the masses measured by the TFOP teams, we have confirmed that these small planets are indeed super-Earths and their slightly larger cousins with thicker atmospheres, sub-Neptunes. Furthermore, an important subgroup of these Level 1 planets is Earth-like in both size and mass.`,
            `sizes among the TESS planet candidates. And about 25 percent of TOIs are not planets at all, but distant eclipsing binary stars, whose eclipses can mimic exoplanet transits. Ongoing observations with higher-angular resolution telescopes, such as the Gaia space mission, will allow astronomers to separate these systems from real transiting planets.`,
            `TESS is also revolutionizing the study of multiplanet systems, especially those with six or more worlds co-orbiting their host star. Such systems were initially discovered by Kepler and the TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope–South (TRAPPIST) survey telescopes. Unfortunately, these early discoveries orbit relatively faint stars — typically 14th magnitude — making them difficult to study.`,
            `As of early 2021, TESS has found more than 80 new multiplanet systems. Four recent discoveries, each with four or more planets, are much closer to Earth than the Kepler and TRAPPIST systems and thus have stellar hosts that appear 30 to 50 times brighter. These are much easier for follow-up observers to study. Brighter host stars also make it easier for JWST and the next generation of giant 30-meter class ground-based telescopes to investigate these planetary atmospheres via spectroscopy. This is because brighter stars mean shorter observations can still detect any potentially biologically interesting signatures in a planet’s atmosphere as light from the host star filters through it.`,
            `Extended mission
                After completing its initial planned two-year survey in July 2020, TESS embarked on a 26-month extended mission. Approved by NASA, this extension allows TESS to search for planets around even more distant stars, as well as follow up on some of the most exciting discoveries from the primary mission.`,
            `This first extended mission consists of three major initiatives: First, TESS will survey the sky a second time, covering the Southern Hemisphere again in the first year and the Northern Hemisphere in the second year. Additionally, TESS will spend 135 days exploring a 12°-wide band along the Ecliptic Plane, which was not probed during the primary mission because we were focused on fully covering the continuous viewing zones for JWST that surround the north and south ecliptic poles. The Kepler Space Telescope’s K2 mission surveyed the ecliptic plane from 2014 to 2018. But measurement uncertainties in transit times mean that some K2 planets could effectively be lost as their real transit periods drift away from the measured (uncertain) periods over the half decade since their discovery, like two clocks ticking out of sync. TESS should recover a large fraction of these more than 400 confirmed K2 planets.`,
            `Second, TESS now takes full-frame images every 10 minutes, down from the primary mission’s 30-minute exposures. More frequent exposures should help catch short-duration exoplanet transits as brief as 40 minutes. This will reveal more Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone of M-dwarf stars, which comprise approximately 75 percent of the stars in our survey. Overall, this improvement could triple the number of planets we expect to find from 50 to 150 — or more. Additionally, a new 20-second exposure capability has been introduced, which improves TESS’s ability to detect and accurately measure stellar flares. It will also help TESS search for exoplanets orbiting white dwarf stars. Such transits had long been predicted when our extended mission was written, but were not confirmed until TESS discovered the first one in 2020: a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting the white dwarf WD 1856.`,
            `Finally, guest investigators will get to choose at least 80 percent of the extended mission’s two-minute cadence mode targets. This mode downloads a small “postage stamp” of pixels around a single star in TESS’s field of view every two minutes. This faster-paced observing can catch the beginning or end phases of bright planet transits. The remaining 20 percent of the extended mission’s two-minute cadence targets will consist of the most promising TOIs from the primary mission.`,

Existing fractures reduce the overall amount of stress, and when this is accounted for, new ones don’t propagate as deep or as high, says Walker. “The exact ice shell thicknesses are not known — but it could just be that Enceladus’ ice shell is thinner than we think at the south pole.” `,

            `(Inside Science) -- What would it take for humans to live on Mars? The first step is to successfully get people to the red planet, of course. Once there, the astronauts would face a task that could be even more difficult: figuring out how to survive in an environment that is vastly different from Earth's. A new study demonstrates one of the challenges -- Earth's plants don’t grow as well when exposed to the level of radiation expected on Mars.`,
            `Wieger Wamelink, an ecologist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands who describes himself as a space farmer, has been frustrated by sci-fi depictions of growing plants on Mars. "What you often see is that they do it in a greenhouse," he said, "but that doesn't block the cosmic radiation," which consists of high-energy particles that may alter the plants' DNA. Mars lacks the same degree of protection from cosmic radiation that the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field provide. To prove his suspicion that cosmic radiation could be dangerous to plants, Wamelink decided to test the hypothesis himself.`,
            `First, Wamelink and his team had to recreate the cosmic radiation. The team settled on using gamma rays generated by radioactive cobalt, even though the actual cosmic radiation that bombards Mars' surface consists of various types of radiation, including alpha and beta particles. But, generating alpha and beta rays on Earth is much more difficult, Wamelink said. It would require a particle accelerator, which Wamelink would love to use, "but I would have to put some plants in the collider for, let's say, two or three months." Considering the high demand for the equipment, "I think it's not ever going to happen," he said.`,
            `Once Wamelink and his team secured radioactive cobalt, the team grew rye and garden cress in two groups: one with typical growing conditions and the other had similar conditions but added gamma radiation. Four weeks after germination, the scientists compared the two groups and saw that the leaves of the group exposed to gamma rays had abnormal shapes and colors. The weights of the plants also differed; the rye plants in the gamma-ray group weighed 48% less than the regular group, and the weight of the garden cress exposed to gamma rays was 32% lower than their unblasted counterparts. Wamelink suspects the weight difference is due to the gamma rays damaging the plants' proteins and DNA. The results were published in the journal Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences this month.`,
            `Michael Dixon, who studies agriculture at the University of Guelph in Canada and wasn't involved in the study, said this research did a reasonable job replicating the cosmic radiation considering that it's impossible to copy it perfectly. Ultimately, researchers would need to study plants on the Martian surface to get a full understanding of the impacts.`,
            `Dixon is a part of a team that's planning to attempt to grow barley on the Moon, which should happen in the next ten years, he said. One of the first questions that Dixon and his co-workers plan to study is whether or not plants can survive the exposure to lunar radiation.`,
            `Wamelink said space agencies should step up their research into crops to improve the quality of the food that astronauts eat. "People at ISS [International Space Station] still eat astronaut food. And that's not very nice," Wamelink said. "I don't know if you ever tasted it, but, well, you don't get happy from it."`,
            `Researching space farming and food production is "way more important than some people think," he said. "Radiation is a problem, but it's solvable, I think."`,

That’s because, from our perspective on Earth, the Moon appears to bob up and down in its orbit — an effect called libration. And just like last month, we’ve got another top-down view this month, allowing us to peek at some of the features on the Moon’s more mysterious farside.`,

In its early seconds, the laws of physics as we understand them didn’t apply. All that would eventually become matter burst forth in a matter of seconds — first particles, like electrons and photons, and eventually neutrons and protons, the building blocks of our atoms. Early seeds of stars, planets, and galaxies expanded out from that momentous point in time and space. It spread in such a way that the universe became highly smooth.`,
            `Smoothness, on an enormous scale, just means that things within the universe are relatively evenly distributed. That is, if you were to put a cube around one section of the universe, it wouldn’t be much more dense than another randomly placed cube. On a smaller scale, like between galaxies or within a solar system, matter is “lumpy” and filled with clusters.`,
            `Physicists theorize that shortly after the Big Bang, something called “inflation” occurred. Essentially, what was once a tiny, packed-together universe expanded out rapidly in a fraction of a second, and it continues to expand today. Inflation is part of the current standard model of the universe, called the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model. In LCDM, the shape of the universe’s trajectory looks, in some depictions, like a funnel, its wide top growing and spreading further out over time.`,

But, Steinhardt says, there are so many possibilities that arise from an inflationary model that it makes the model itself less useful.`,

            `Mathematically, the Big Bang looks like it came from an undefined state — something that isn’t explained by the laws of physics under Einstein’s theory of general relativity. This is also called a “singularity.” To Steinhardt — but not to everyone — that’s the mathematical equivalent of a red flag. “We all learned in school, when you get one over zero for an answer, you're in trouble, because that's a nonsense answer. You made a mistake.”`,
            `In a related problem, there’s also some difficulty in reconciling the inflation theory with string theory and quantum mechanics, says Steinhardt. If the model correctly described the universe, other accepted frameworks of physics would agree with it. Instead, Steinhardt says they’re at odds. “When one's thinking about cosmology, you’re often reaching across fields of thinking, which are quite distant, either on the astro side or on the fundamental physics side and seeing, do they fit together?” The cyclic model, he says, helps do this.`,

            `A cyclic model of the universe is designed to solve some of the seemingly unsolvable problems of the Big Bang and inflation models. “It allows us to go beyond the Big Bang, but without any kind of magical philosophical issues,” says Stephon Alexander, a professor of physics at Brown University, and the co-inventor of an inflation model of the universe based on string theory. “Because time has always existed in the past.”`,
            `Scientists have proposed a cyclic model that could work mathematically in a few ways. Steinhardt and Turok’s model of a cyclic universe is one of them. Its core principles are these: The Big Bang was not the beginning of time; there was a previous phase leading up to it, with multiple cycles of contraction and expansion that repeat indefinitely; and the key period defining the shape of our universe was right before the so-called bang. There you would find a period of slow contraction called the Big Crunch.`,
            `So, instead of a beginning of time arising out of nothing, the cyclic model allows for a long period of time in the lead-up. It claims to fix the same problems as the inflationary theory did, but builds even further. For one thing, the existence of time before the Big Crunch removes the singularity problem — that undefined number. It also utilizes string theory and quantum fluctuations.`,
            `Like the LCDM, a cyclic model would also account for dark energy, an unobservable force that scientists believe is behind the accelerating expansion of the universe. But in Stenhardt and Turok’s model, things get a little more like science fiction: Two identical planes, or “branes,” (in string theory, an object that can have any number of dimensions) come together and expand apart. We can observe the three dimensions of our plane, but not the extra dimensions of the other. Dark energy is both the force leading the branes into a collision, with separation between them. Expansion of the branes themselves follows, and dark energy draws them together again once they’re as flat and smooth as they can become.`,
            `Giani, the researcher, isn’t so sure, because of some of the assumptions this model brings in from string theory. He likes another cyclic model from Roger Penrose, a theoretical physicist at Oxford who came up with what Penrose himself called “an outrageous new perspective” on the universe. “I was completely amazed by it,” Giani said.`,
            `It’s hard to wrap your head around: In the distant, distant future, our solar system and galaxy will be engulfed by black holes, which eat up all the other mass in the universe, and then after an unimaginable amount of time, only black holes will exist. Eventually, only photons exist, which have no mass and therefore no energy or frequency, according to our accepted laws of physics.`,
            `Measurements of scale, Penrose explains, no longer apply at this stage, but the shape of the universe remains. At the moment of the Big Bang, he argues, when particles are so hot and close together that they also move at almost the speed of light, they also lose their mass. This creates the same conditions at the Big Bang as the cold, distant future universe. Their scale is no longer relevant, and one can beget the other. The remote future and the Big Bang become one and the same.`,

They balance the small sliver of the universe we can observe with mathematical models and theory to fill in the rest. So, in cosmology, scientists search for observable phenomena that disprove their models, and reshape their theories again to suit the problem.`,
            `But as our technology rapidly advances, observations that support or detract from one model or another come more often. “It's completely worth making all this speculation in this work, because we are getting to the point in which this data will arrive,” Giani says. One such observation could produce compelling support for either a cyclic model or confirm the more accepted inflationary theory.`,
            `Because of how matter is distributed in our view of the oldest part of the universe (seen in the CMB), gravitational waves that reach us may be polarized, like light, at a particular frequency. Soon — within a few years, in fact — scientists may be able to determine whether this polarization exists. If it does, it will support the inflationary model. If this polarization doesn’t exist, it will undermine “slow contraction,” a hallmark of the cyclic model.`,

            `Spiral galaxies appear to be the most numerous readily observable type of galaxy, with the ellipticals coming in a rather distant second. Although dwarf spheroidal galaxies — like the Sculptor and Fornax Dwarfs — are the most common in the universe as a whole, they are not observable beyond the Local Group. Irregular galaxies make up only three to four percent of known galaxies, and the peculiar galaxies come in at less than one percent. Of course, galaxies that have peculiarities are more common — such as M87, the supergiant elliptical whose famous jet gives it a "p" for "peculiar" in its classification: E0p.`,
            `There are a number of things which can give galaxies the distinction of being peculiar — such as:`,
            `strange shapes`,
            `strange halos`,
            `rings`,
            `plumes and tails`,
            `unusual dark lanes`,
            `unusual placement of HII regions`,
            `excessively bright or peculiar nuclei`,
            `apparent explosions`,
            `particularly distorted interactions with other galaxies`,
            `possible interactions with intergalactic clouds of dust or gas.`,
            `Some of these — like the last — are extremely rare, but examples of each sort have been observed. And even though all peculiar galaxies are relatively rare, there are quite a few in the Messier catalog. M49 is not generally listed as being peculiar in any way, but it does have a very faint bridge linking it with a tiny irregular galaxy estimated to be about 17th magnitude. M51's companion, NGC 5195, is a very dusty peculiar galaxy. M64 has an out-of-place dark patch giving it its title of the "Black-eye Galaxy." M66 is a barred spiral with somewhat asymmetric arms, and M77 is a Seyfert-type galaxy with a brilliant nucleus which seems to be exploding. M101 has very asymmetric arms, as does M106. The exploding M82 with its knotty structure is probably the most famous peculiar galaxy.`,
            `N772s`,
            `Except for the case of galaxies which are obviously involved in a gravitational interaction, the causes of most galactic peculiarities are quite mysterious. For instance, astronomers can't yet explain why some galaxies seem to be exploding. The same can be said about distorted halos, strange dust lanes, and tails and plumes in seemingly-non-interacting galaxies.`,
            `Most rich clusters of galaxies have their share of peculiar galaxies. Some are “in the thick of the action,” where relatively recent interactions with several galaxies may well have caused their present peculiarity, but others are isolated outlying members of the cluster.`,
            `Sometimes an explanation is found after intensive study. An excellent example of this is NGC 520, a 13th-magnitude galaxy in Pisces with two tails and a heavy central dust lane. Only within the past few years has its “true” nature come to light. The most recent studies imply that this bizarre galaxy is actually two galaxies, both dusty spirals (like M64 or M90), in the process of colliding.`,
            `Since practically every type of galaxy has a peculiar counterpart somewhere else in the universe, it isn't surprising that a wide variety of peculiarities can occur in any given class of galaxies. While most deep-sky observers know about the jet in M87, they may not have heard of the four jets shooting out of the barred spiral NGC 1097. This discovery adds the small “p” designation to that galaxy’s classification. One jet actually cuts a spiral arm, which in short-exposure photographs can be seen to have “slipped” out of line with the rest of the arm!`,

            `Except for some of the brighter peculiar galaxies, most of these objects lack real beauty unless they are currently involved with other galaxies. And since most peculiar galaxies are fainter than 13th magnitude, you will need a large aperture to observe them at all. Still, the mere observation of the target galaxy is often enough for even the most experienced observers.The fact that you have observed a galaxy you know is a celestial oddball can be quite satisfying in itself, and actually seeing the feature which makes the galaxy peculiar is just “icing on the cake.”`,
            `The techniques involved in observing peculiar galaxies depend on the type of peculiarity the particular galaxy has. If the galaxy is a face-on spiral, it will be difficult to observe because you are looking through the thin plane of the galaxy. If it is inclined more to our line of sight, it will be easier to observe. The detection of dark lanes is easier than detecting bright areas, unless the bright areas are very bright.`,
            `So let's be honest: Observing the peculiar features visually is generally difficult to impossible. The extended halos which give certain galaxies their peculiar designation require a very large aperture to be observed with any degree of certainty. Extensions, such as tails, are usually too low in surface brightness to be seen with any amateur instrument. Irregular galaxies are generally so thin and diffuse that they are hard to see, so unless the peculiar irregular is bright, you'll be lucky to see the galaxy at all — much less its peculiarity.`,
            `Turning to somewhat more visible features, strange or asymmetric arm structures can sometimes be seen as an uneven hazy patch. If dark patches are large or broad enough, they might be visible in moderate-size telescopes. But bright HII regions have to be of immense size in order to be observable, so you can safely assume that you won't be able to see most extragalactic HII regions individually. As a chain or large clump, though, these regions of ionized hydrogen will make the glow of the galaxy brighter in that particular area. Explosive galaxies — like the Seyferts — reveal a bright stellar nucleus, and given sufficient aperture, they are among the easiest peculiar features to observe.`,

            `NGC 1961 has recently been identified as the largest known spiral galaxy in the universe, containing some 2 trillion stars in a galaxy 600,000 light-years across. It is also unusual in having a highly asymmetric spiral structure, as if it had interacted with another galaxy, but there are none around. Since the arms are too low in surface brightness to be seen in a 21-inch telescope, their structure seems to be beyond the capability of amateur instruments.

At −43°, this galaxy is not favorably-placed for observation from the northern United States. With a magnitude of 7.5, it would be one of the most spectacular sights in a small telescope from a Southern Hemisphere location. If you do observe this galaxy, remember that you are looking at the nearest of all double-lobed radio sources, and if your eyes could see radio waves, Centaurus A would appear truly immense, with giant lobes spreading out of the eyepiece field on both sides.`,

            `M101 is another of the peculiar Messier galaxies. The arms of this Sc spiral are fairly asymmetric, but for no apparent reason. There are a number of dwarf galaxies in the area, but they just don’t seem large enough to cause the observed distortion. This galaxy is more difficult to see than its magnitude of 8.5 would lead you to believe, because it is face-on to us and has a rather low surface brightness. With moderate-size instruments it appears as a huge roundish patch, but the arms can be glimpsed in large telescopes.`,

Daniel Frost, a geophysicist at the University of California, Berkeley, and lead author of the new study, jokes that he is “always having to justify the importance of the inner core.” In fact, we owe it our existence — as it cools, it releases heat and creates convection in the outer core. Ultimately, that churning liquid iron (known as the geodynamo) generates the magnetic field that protects life on this planet from dangerous solar winds.`,
            `Likewise, the upper layers influence the core. “Everything is affected by what’s above it,” Frost says. The inner core is surrounded by the outer core, the outer core by the mantle, the mantle by the crust. So in order for the inner core to grow, it must transfer its heat — some residual from Earth’s formation, some radioactive from decaying elements — to each successive layer. In turn, each layer must be capable of receiving the heat.`,
            `That suggests one possible mechanism for the inner core’s uneven cooling. The point of greatest growth beneath Indonesia is a major subduction zone. There, relatively cool chunks of tectonic plates plunge into and chill the burning mantle. “It’s kind of like dropping ice cubes in,” Frost says. This temperature gradient allows the deeper layers to shed their heat, thereby solidifying the inner core.`,
            `While these “ice cubes” are puny, he suspects they may be enough to tip the scale. “This is all a delicate balance,” he says. “I don’t think you need much to precipitate a difference like this.” However, this explanation may be too simplistic: It’s unclear whether heat from the bowels of the Earth dissipates in a vertical line. The diving Indonesian crust might just as easily cool the core lying underneath, say, China or Saudi Arabia, rather than below Indonesia.`,

            `For now, the asymmetry itself remains unexplained, but it does offer one solution to another longstanding enigma: why the iron crystals in the inner core align parallel to Earth’s North-South rotation axis. (No one has observed the structure of the core directly, but seismologists have observed that earthquakes travel faster through the core between the North and South Poles than across the equator.) All things being equal, the crystals should be aligned randomly.`,
            `The Berkeley researchers suggest the answer lies in the core’s lopsided formation. As gravity redistributes the crystals, it brings them into a sort of “flow,” according to their computer model. “Imagine throwing sticks into a river,” Frost says. “If the river is flowing, the sticks will align with the flow.” Similarly, because the inner core is flowing, the crystals align with it and form an orderly lattice that serves as a high-speed interstate for subterranean tremors.`,
            `To understand the connection between this asymmetry and the magnetic field, more research is needed. But given the vital role this planetary armor plays in our existence, it’s worth investigating the processes that underpin it. Scientists have long known that the magnetic field reverses every so often (we’re overdue for a switch), and that it weakens temporarily during transition. But it isn’t evident why. When it comes to new findings on the Earth’s core, Frost says, “The question is always, ‘Does this relate to the reversal of the magnetic field?’”`,

            `arth’s atmosphere and magnetic field protect us from harmful space radiation, but passengers bound for Mars will lose that protection. So, their spaceship would need to provide some kind of radiation shielding.`,
            `Depending on where radiation comes from, it may be made of different particles and have different energies, which would require different means of shielding and pose different levels of danger to our radiation-prone DNA. For example, radiations from energetic particles ejected from the sun behave very differently than cosmic rays from outside our galaxy. `,
            `So, how many times more radiation would a Mars-bound astronaut experience compared to what they would experience on Earth? `,
            `Enough to be of concern, according to Athanasios Petridis, a physicist from Drake University in Des Moines. According to calculations by his team, high-end estimates for radiation exposure during a round trip to Mars are in the range of several Sieverts (Sv). For reference, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has set 0.05 Sv/year as the dose limit for workers who are exposed to radiation at their jobs.`,
            `Solar weather also plays a role in the amount of radiation you would get in space. For instance, the 11-year solar cycle affects the amount of radiation the sun emits. However, due to the complicated interplay between sun-generated radiation and cosmic rays from outer space, it may not be worth it to time the launch around these cycles. `,
            `“There are enough competing factors in radiation exposure that trying to plan around the solar cycle is like trying to time the stock market, which usually results in losing,” said Kerry Lee, a radiation analyst from NASA in Houston, Texas.`,
            `The lack of gravity can also wreak havoc on the human body given enough time. Astronauts aboard space stations have been shown to lose 1 to 1.5 % of the mineral density in their weight-bearing bones every month. They also tend to lose muscle mass, even when exercising as much as they do on Earth. `,
            `“There are plenty of risks associated with space flight. I don’t think these are deal breakers for missions to Mars,” said Lee. “[NASA has] had several crew members do missions approaching a year in space. Also, there are countermeasures in place that have been proven to slow and stop the loss of muscle mass and bone density while in space.”`,
            `An undergraduate team of researchers from Drake University, with the project name of Magneto-Ionization Spacecraft Shield for Interplanetary Travel, or MISSFIT, is trying to calculate the tradeoffs among different engineering solutions for radiation shielding and artificial gravity. `,
            `“Say, if you want to create artificial gravity through rotation, you may want to make the radius of the spacecraft as large as you can, but the bigger the radius, the bigger the magnetic field you will need for radiation shielding,” said Petridis, the project leader for MISSFIT. “There’s always a tradeoff.”`,
            `The project aims to give undergraduate physics students valuable experience conducting original research. “We try to make it a very exciting project, and anything related to space travel is exciting,” Petridis said. `,

            `Without any mind-blowing sci-fi level breakthroughs, the only practical way to imitate gravity on a trip to Mars is by spinning the spacecraft and creating a centripetal force. (You could theoretically accelerate the spacecraft to mimic gravity, but that would mean throttling the rocket to provide the G-force before braking once past the middle point -- a completely impractical approach given the fuel requirement.) `,
            `For the centripetal approach, the larger the spin radius -- perhaps in the shape of a hoop -- the closer it would resemble the feel of the gravity on Earth. But it would also be more difficult to launch and may require assembly in space. `,
            `It will also be more difficult to provide enough radiation shielding for the larger structure. `,
            `“I mean, you can wrap the whole spacecraft in lead if you want to, but it's gonna be really heavy, and completely impractical,” said Keegan Finger, an undergraduate physics major from Drake University. “That’s why we are looking at magnetic shielding -- to try to save on weight."`,
            `Finger and his classmates discussed their progress on the project at the April 2021 meeting of the American Physical Society, held virtually this year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.`,
            `“We are working on calculating the energy requirements for the different kinds of magnetic shielding. We are also looking at different configurations of the magnetic field rather than the standard two dipole system,” said Petridis. The shape of the magnetic shield may be tailored to better suit the living quarter configuration aboard the spacecraft.`,
            `“We also need to consider what levels of radiation at what specific energies we need to shield from,” said Will Thomas, another physics undergrad working for the project. For example, what combination of physical shields, bodysuits, and magnetic field can best guard the astronauts from the different kinds of radiation in space. `,
            `The project is expanding to include biology majors to consider the effect of imitated gravity on the human body. The goal is to find a combination of strategies that can best minimize the overall health risk posed by deep space travel.`,
            `There can be subtle differences in the different ways of imitating gravity, for instance, regarding the intricate physics of our cardiovascular system. `,
            `“For example, what effects do the gradient of gravity and the Coriolis force have on blood flow?” said Petridis. “Look, we can handle the math and the computations, but as physicists, we have no idea how the cardiovascular system works, so we need this to be an interdisciplinary collaboration. Because that’s what real-world problems are, they are interdisciplinary.”`,

At 8:16 p.m. EDT on Aug. 19 (00:16 UTC on Aug. 20), Earth will slide between the gas giant and our star, placing Jupiter directly opposite the Sun in our sky. In other words, Jupiter will reach opposition. Like a Super Moon, this will briefly make ol’ Jove a Super Planet.`,

It will be 373 million miles (600 million kilometers) from Earth and it will appear 49" in diameter, which is only 1" less than its maximum size. Fortunately, catching the exact moment of opposition isn’t critical, as the view will be essentially the same for roughly 10 days on either side of the event itself. This offers observers ample time to seek out the gas giant’s most intimate details. And from shredding cyclonic masses to spotted tropical storms, Jupiter’s ever-changing cloud tops never fail to reward.`,

Careful observations during the most pristine moments of steady atmospheric seeing, however, reveal even finer details. These include bright and dark spots, looping festoons, and other shapes that, despite their solid appearance, are in a state of perpetual change. Such shapeshifting is a result of powerful jet streams whipping both west to east (prograde; in the direction of rotation) and east to west (retrograde; opposite the direction of rotation) across the planet.`,
            `These jets separate Jupiter’s bands, and the instabilities they introduce can spur atmospheric waves and cyclonic storms, as well as eruptive plumes that distort the flow and color of the planet’s zones.

However, it’s hard to know what will happen in the area during this opposition.`,

SEB fade-and-return cycles can occur at intervals ranging from about three to 15 years. But then again, droughts between cycles can last as long as 36 years, with many intervening years of normal SEB activity. During this opposition, look for a possible color shift in the bright SEB zone, which has shown signs of yellowing in early 2021.`,

This expansion is associated with the dramatic and chaotic mixing of bright and dark material. After such an event occurred in 2017, the NEB ballooned again, as predicted, in May 2020.`,
            `First, a bright rift developed in the northern part of the NEB. It soon ejected dark material to both the north and south — perhaps as gas from the bright, ammonia-depleted plumes fell back into the deeper (and darker) jovian atmosphere. Shortly after this activity, new dark elliptical features called barges, as well as white ovals, developed. While this action appears to be on the wane, it’s unknown whether renewed activity might follow.`,

A return of the disturbance — which astronomers initially predicted for the 2019 to 2021 period — began a bit early (mid-2018).

This technique focuses on just one small section of the planet, allowing the observer to record as much detail as possible over the course of, say, 30 minutes to an hour or more. The method allows the sketcher to take advantage of crisp moments of perfect atmospheric seeing to record sub-arcsecond details in a small region of interest.

            `On Aug. 18, 2020, a spectacular eruption occurred in Jupiter’s North Tropical Belt (NTB) jet stream, producing an elaborate wake. Scientists had forecast that the eruption would occur in 2021, but it went off a year early. As the storm stretched out over time, amateurs discovered two more storms at the same latitude. All of them were superfast plumes with turbulent wakes that disrupted the entire width of the North Tropical Zone (NTZ), as well as the southern edge of the NTB.`,
            `While it’s common for storms to pop up in this region every six years or so — often, multiple storms rage — it’s unknown whether more events will continue to materialize during this year’s opposition. While the individual plumes themselves are short-lived, color changes within the zone usually follow. And observations in early 2021 revealed that the NTZ has indeed become smoggy, mimicking the color of the northern EZ.`,

            `Have you ever seen a meteor streak through the sky? If you’re a longtime backyard astronomer, you’ve probably seen hundreds, if not thousands. And even those unfamiliar with the night sky will likely have glimpsed at least a few “shooting stars” over the years.`,
            `That’s because meteors are far more common than most realize. In fact, as many as a half-dozen sporadic meteors zip across the sky every hour. So, even during a brief evening outing, you’ve got a good chance to spot one. Those odds dramatically increase during a meteor shower, too. And wouldn’t you know it, on the evening of Aug. 12/13, we’ll be entertained by the peak of one of the best showers of the year: the Perseids.`,
            `Like most meteor showers, the Perseids owe their existence to a comet — in this case, periodic Comet Swift-Tuttle. As this cosmic relic orbits the Sun, it leaves behind a trail of particles the size of sand grains. Whenever Earth intersects Swift-Tuttle’s orbit and passes through this debris field, we see a surplus of meteors. Each flash across the sky signifies the fiery death of one of those tiny space crumbs, as it tears through Earth’s atmosphere and succumbs to the heat of friction. Because this falling space dust comes from the same place, Perseid meteors all appear to streak outward from a specific region, called a radiant. In this case, the radiant is located near the northern part of the constellation Perseus, hence the shower’s name.`,
            `People have been admiring the Perseids for almost 2,000 years, with the earliest reference coming from a Chinese observer in a.d. 36. Today, the Perseids are the most observed of all meteor showers. That’s not because they’re the richest (that title would go to the December Geminids), but because they occur at a time of year when warm evening temperatures make for comfortable observing for many.`,
            `Here’s what you’ll want to do to get the most out of this year’s Perseid display: In the days leading up to peak activity, pick out an observing site that’s far from bright lights and affords as open a view of the sky, especially toward the northeast, where the shower’s radiant will be. As with most meteor showers, the Perseids don’t really kick into high gear until after midnight. However, you can begin to see activity around 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. on the evening of Aug. 12, when Perseus has risen above the northeast horizon. This isn’t a sprint, so you’ll want to stay relaxed and plan to observe from a lounge chair. If you live in northerly locations, make sure to dress in warm layers and bring a blanket. For those in more southerly regions, don’t forget the insect repellent.`,
            `If you’ve never before witnessed a meteor shower, be forewarned that it isn’t really a “shower.” It’s more of a slow — though beautiful — drip from a leaky faucet. Even a rich shower like the Perseids produces just one meteor every minute or so. Still, that’s a pretty impressive rate, especially to someone who has never before seen a meteor. `,
            `What makes watching the Perseids, or any meteor shower for that matter, so riveting is the fact that you don’t know exactly where or when the next flash will appear. The farther from the radiant, the longer the meteor’s streak. In fact, a Perseid coming straight at you from the radiant will appear as a mere spark of light. Have no fear, though; it will have vaporized while still 50 to 60 miles (80 to 97 kilometers) above ground. Most Perseids will be roughly as bright as a 2nd- or 3rd-magnitude star. But there’s always the possibility of an exceptionally brilliant meteor — called a fireball — that’s bright enough to cast a shadow, as well as leave a luminous afterglow in its wake. One final note: These meteors move fast, traveling at some 37 miles per second (60 km/s)! That means the typical Perseid is visible for barely a second or two.`,
            `In the days following the 2021 Perseids, you may feel one of two emotions — elation, if you’ve seen dozens of meteors, or frustration, if you’ve been clouded out. In either case, the Perseid meteors return every August (although the 2022 visit will be hampered by a Moon that’s just two nights past Full). There are also other annual meteor showers you can enjoy. Your next best bet is the Quadrantid shower, which will peak on the evening of Jan. 2/3, when the New Moon won’t wash anything out.`,
            `For more information on observing meteors and showers, visit the websites of the American Meteor Society (www.amsmeteors.org) and the International Meteor Organization (www.imo.net). Alternatively, you can refer to the annual edition of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada’s Observer’s Handbook, which devotes an entire section to meteor observing.`,

            `You probably remember your grade school science teachers explaining that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. That’s a fundamental property of the universe.`,
            `Energy can be transformed, however. When the Sun’s rays reach Earth, they are transformed into random motions of molecules that you feel as heat. At the same time, Earth and the atmosphere are sending radiation back into space. The balance between the incoming and outgoing energy is known as Earth’s “energy budget.”`,
            `Our climate is determined by these energy flows. When the amount of energy coming in is more than the energy going out, the planet warms up.`,
            `That can happen in a few ways, such as when sea ice that normally reflects solar radiation back into space disappears and the dark ocean absorbs that energy instead. It also happens when greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere and trap some of the energy that otherwise would have radiated away.`,
            `Scientists like me have been measuring the Earth’s energy budget since the 1980s using instruments on satellites, in the air and oceans, and on the ground. It’s an important part of the new climate assessment from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released Aug. 9, 2021.`,
            `Here’s a closer look at how energy flows and what the energy budget tells us about how and why the planet is warming.`,
            `Balancing energy from the Sun`,
            `Virtually all the energy in the Earth’s climate system comes from the Sun. Only a tiny fraction is conducted upward from the Earth’s interior.`,
            `On average, the planet receives 340.4 watts of sunshine per square meter. All sunshine falls on the daytime side, and the numbers are much higher at local noon.`,
            `Of that 340.4 watts per square meter:`,
            `99.9 watts are reflected back into space by clouds, dust, snow and the Earth’s surface.`,
            `The remaining 240.5 watts are absorbed – about a quarter by the atmosphere and the rest by the surface of the planet. This radiation is transformed into thermal energy within the Earth system.`,
            `Almost all of the absorbed energy is matched by energy emitted back into space. However, a residual now accumulates as global warming. That residual has increased, from just under 0.6 watts per square meter at the end of the last century to 0.79 in 2006-2018, according to the latest data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The vast majority of that is now heating the oceans. While it might sound like a small number, that energy adds up.`,
            `file2021080160302lqj5wj`,
            `The atmosphere absorbs a lot of energy and emits it as radiation both into space and back down to the planet’s surface. In fact, Earth’s surface gets almost twice as much radiation from the atmosphere as it does from direct sunshine. That’s primarily because the Sun heats the surface only during the day, while the warm atmosphere is up there 24/7.`,
            `Together, the energy reaching Earth’s surface from the Sun and from the atmosphere is about 504 watts per square meter. Earth’s surface emits about 79% of that back out. The remaining surface energy goes into evaporating water and warming the air, oceans and land.`,
            `The residual between incoming sunshine and outgoing infrared is due to the accumulation of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide in the air. These gases are transparent to sunlight but opaque to infrared rays – they absorb and emit a lot of infrared rays back down.`,
            `Earth’s surface temperature must increase in response until the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation is restored.`,

            `While the thought of ice at the equator may be difficult to imagine, there is compelling evidence that much, if not all, of Earth’s land and oceans were once covered by ice — an event known as “Snowball Earth.”`,
            `The rocks of South Australia’s Flinders Ranges contain clues of this extreme ice age. Before tectonic forces worked to lift the mountains from the bottom of the ocean to the heights they occupy today, glacial ice carried boulders from afar and dropped them at the site. The fact that the boulders were deposited within a few degrees of the equator can only mean one thing; At some point in Earth’s history, ice occupied low latitudes.`,

But one question has plagued researchers for nearly a century: how did early life manage to survive to that point? With massive ice sheets sealing off water from the atmosphere, the oceans would have had little to no oxygen for inhabitants.`,

            `To answer this question, a team of researchers turned to layers of iron- and silica-rich sedimentary rocks known as banded iron formations (BIFs), deposited in the ocean during Snowball Earth and now found in the Flinders Ranges.`,
            `“Of all the Snowball rocks, BIFs are the only ones that are like an ice-core — a constant tape-recorder at the bottom of the seafloor that captured clues as to what happened during Snowball Earth,” says Ross Mitchell, a geologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China, and lead author of a new study published in Nature Communications.`,
            `The BIFs formed when layers of sea ice prevented the exchange of oxygen between the atmosphere and the ocean, allowing iron from underwater volcanic eruptions to build up in the seawater. However, the periodic layers of silica are evidence that pulses of oxygen must have been involved as well.`,
            `“Layers like this don’t form when the ocean is completely sealed off with ice,” says Mitchell.`,
            `To examine how oxygen could have entered the ocean during Snowball Earth, he and his colleagues measured the extent to which the BIFs became magnetized when exposed to a magnetic field. They discovered that the timing of changes in Earth’s orbit (known as Milankovitch cycles) aligned well with the timing of variations in the rocky layers.`,

            `One possible interpretation of the newest finding is that Milankovitch cycles caused ice sheets to advance and retreat in rhythm with the changes in incoming solar radiation. This would explain why rocks, such as those at the Flinders Ranges, alternate between the sedimentary layers of BIFs and glacial deposits.  `,
            `The researchers report that the BIFs were deposited during hundreds of glacial advances and retreats over a period of four million years. “Our new data suggests that the ice retreat opened ice-free areas, allowing oxygen to mix into the oceans and enabling life to persist during Snowball Earth,” says Mitchell.`,

            `During advances of continental ice sheets, the pressure from overlying ice causes melting beneath the glacier. At grounding lines (where ice sheets meet the ocean), meltwater enters the ocean — along with whatever oxygen was trapped inside as air bubbles when the ice formed.`,
            `Sediments from around the world contribute evidence that this occurred during Snowball Earth.

            `Halverson and his team of researchers examined BIFs in a 2019 study and found that the convergence of oxygen-rich meltwater and iron-rich seawater at grounding lines likely provided enough energy to sustain life during this time. The advance and retreat of ice due to Earth’s orbital cycles could have opened more areas in the ocean and contributed to this oxygen pump at grounding lines during Snowball Earth.`,

            `Today, more people than ever are working remotely, managing their projects and submitting reports from afar. But there are a select few who have the most extreme version of remote work imaginable: piloting a complex, cutting-edge machine sitting on another world.`,
            `These are Mars rover drivers, who are responsible for guiding the most expensive cars to ever be designed, built, and exported off-planet.`,
            `Though some might think that driving across martian terrain is a heart-pumping, adrenaline-fueled activity, the reality is a bit more complicated. Far from bounding across the surface and kicking up trails of dust — as Apollo astronauts did in their lunar rovers — the driver of a Mars rover must carefully choreograph every turn of the wheels. It can take up to 20 minutes or more for commands from Earth to reach Mars, and just as long before drivers learn whether the rover has safely executed those commands. Mars rover drivers also work decidedly non-standard hours: Shifts are based on martian time, which slips forward by 40 minutes every day relative to Earth.`,
            `But the thrill of exploration is well worth it, according to those who have the otherworldly job.`,
            `“There were times when we were crawling along a crater rim, taking close-up pictures of everything we saw, to read the history of the terrain the crater cut into,” says Scott Maxwell, who drove both the Spirit and Opportunity rovers during the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission. “There were weeks where we were using the robotic arm’s instruments to study the history of one particularly interesting rock. … And then there were the weeks when we were just driving like a bat out of martian hell to get to the next destination. One of the great things about this kind of exploration is that there’s always something new.”`,

            `Officially titled Rover Planners (RP), rover drivers are initially sidelined after a rover touches down. But once the engineering team has tested out the instruments and the science team has collected initial data, the reins are handed over to the RPs.
                There are always at least two or three drivers at the helm of any rover, and occasionally more if additional expertise or assistance is needed. Generally, the person designated as RP-1 takes the lead, constructing sequences of moves, while the person designated as RP-2 acts as an advisor and consultant to RP-1.
                When sending commands to a rover on a planet as far as 240 million miles (390 million kilometers) from Earth, schedules can be extremely tight. To map out complex moves, drivers use software created at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to make a 3-D replica of the martian terrain using navigation camera images and a computer program that simulates the actual movement of the rover. They must then program the rover movement each day (or even a few days in advance) to run the command sequence for the target.
                To make sure complicated sequences are carried out as planned, drivers may simulate their maneuvers up to 20 times to find the best course of action based on the terrain and soil conditions. Sometimes, they may simulate their moves with a full-scale rover model in a test bed — an outdoor “sandbox” with dirt and rocks that simulates the martian surface.
                “It's kind of up to us to figure out how to do it safely, or even if we can do it safely,” says Heather Justice, a driver for the Perseverance and MER who has worked at NASA since 2011. “We’ll coordinate with [the science team] to figure out exactly where they want to go. And then [the drivers] spend time trying to figure out what’s the way to make sure we’re getting there safely.”
                Getting it right the first time is extremely important. It takes multiple meetings, checks and double-checks to decide the course of action after targets are acquired. These procedures are critically important, lest one drive a multi-billion-dollar rover off into a crater.
                “Now let’s say you get paid $100,000 a year and you work for 40 years,” remarks Maxwell. “That's $4 million. In some sense, ‘blowing a sol’— making a single mistake that messed up a day on Mars — would wipe out something in the neighborhood of all the value you would generate over your working lifetime. Oh, not to mention that you’re in charge of one of humanity's most priceless assets and that screwing it up could be an incalculable failure, far beyond what can be measured in mere dollars.”
                Learning to live on a new schedule is also part of a driver’s duties. With a sol — or a martian day — clocking in almost 40 minutes longer than an Earth day, drivers must alter their daily routines and body clocks to match. But losing one’s sense of a day and a consistent schedule can be well worth the price.
                “[Living on Mars time] emphasized the uniqueness and specialness of what we were doing,” said Maxwell. “We were the only people on the planet who were coming to work every day on the schedule of another planet!”`,

Now, drivers are more able to precisely and safely take control through a system called Automatic Navigation (AutoNav), an autonomous driving mode that helps the rover reach specific martian coordinates. Think a self-driving car.`,
            `“Using AutoNav, we’ll be able to just tell the rover that we want to drive to this point really far away, and just let it kind of take its own images and figure out what’s the safest way to get there,” says Justice. “On MER, much of our sequence building was very manual — for example, typing out individual drive commands.

The survey asked people to agree or disagree with a number of statements about the potential value of these launches, the motivation behind the launches and who will have access to space. In response to every question, people were supportive of space travel and the technological developments that come from it. Yet, respondents also viewed these events as ego trips generally limited to rich people.`,
            `To understand whether people think these endeavors are important, one statement was: “Space travel and research are important for the future development of humanity.” Seventy-four percent of respondents agreed, with similar results across all political parties. Similarly, over two–thirds of people agreed with the idea “The recent space launches by Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are important for the future development of space travel and technology.”`,

In response to the statement “The launches make me believe that one day soon ordinary people will be able to go to space,” 58% of people agreed.

Of people interested in vaccines, 79% think space travel is important versus 60% of those opposed to vaccines. While both groups still agree that space travel is important, the gap was one of the largest in the sample. I believe this could reflect differing views on science in general.`,

Although astronomers often talk about black holes as being gigantic objects, it’s important to remember they’re usually referring to the object’s mass, not its physical size.`,

After depleting the last of its remaining nuclear fuel, the star’s uncontested gravity causes it to rapidly collapse before rebounding outward in an epic blast known as a supernova. What remains, depending on the mass of the star, will either be a neutron star or a black hole. These stellar-mass black holes can range from a couple to several dozen times the mass of the Sun.`,

            `Earth has a mass of some 6x1024 kilograms. And though that’s more massive than any human can truly comprehend, when it comes to black holes, Earth is puny.`,
            `To create a black hole, you need enough mass that the object’s gravity overcomes any outward forces preventing it from total collapse. This is why there are no known black holes as light as Earth — they just wouldn’t have enough mass to completely collapse. (However, some scientists think there could be a class of ancient primordial black holes forged in the first few moments after the big bang. These theoretical black holes could range from less massive than a paperclip to tens of thousands of times the mass of the Sun.)`,
            `At the center of a black hole is believed to be an infinite gravitational well in the fabric of spacetime, called a gravitational singularity. This singularity is infinitely dense, and anything that reaches it is stuck there for good. The outer edge of the black hole, called the event horizon, is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole, including light. Where this event horizon starts depends on the mass of the black hole and was first calculated by German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild in 1916.`,
            `Using the Schwarzschild radius calculation, a black hole the size of Earth would have a radius of less than one inch, making it about as big as a ping pong ball. The Sun, on the other hand, would have a radius of just under two miles.`,

            `Black holes are notoriously difficult for scientists to find. This is because, unlike stars, light that falls within a black hole’s event horizon will never be seen. However, sometimes a black hole has an accretion disk — a halo of material around the black hole that glows as it violently grinds together. The light emitted from such accretion disks makes it possible for scientists to find these otherwise invisible objects. Astronomers also spot black holes by noticing how they affect other objects, including stars. For instance, scientists discovered Sagittarius A* after spotting the odd behavior of seven stars orbiting it.`,
            `With these methods, scientists have found many black hole candidates over the years, including the smallest known black hole located in a binary system called GRO J1655-40. The visible companion star in this system is dumping gas onto the black hole, generating enough energy to power a microquasar.`,
            `Quasars develop in extremely luminous active galactic nuclei, which are the centers of galaxies hosting a supermassive black hole that is surrounded by a bright and energetic accretion disk. The black hole in GRO J1655-40 is estimated to weigh about 5.4 times the mass of the Sun, which would give it a radius of about 10 miles. By studying microquasars such as this, astronomers hope to better understand the possible link between the monsters lurking in galactic cores and smaller, accreting black holes spread throughout galaxies.`,
            `In 2008, scientists believed they had found an even smaller black hole, but the mass was later corrected by the same team. Any smaller black holes would likely be due to the merger of two neutron stars rather than the collapse of a dying star. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory detected gravitational waves from a possible neutron star merger in 2017, just two years after detecting gravitational waves for the first time. Gravitational waves emitted during mergers provide a new way for scientists to identify black holes within 100 million light-years of Earth.`,
            `On the other end of the spectrum, the size of a stellar-mass black hole depends on how massive the original star was. The most massive star found to date is R136a1 and weighs in at 315 times the mass of the Sun. If it stayed at its current mass, the resulting black hole from its inevitable collapse would have a radius of some 578 miles. Although large compared to the smallest known black holes, even this hefty stellar-mass black hole pales in comparison to its supermassive cousins.`,

Though the conclusion was somewhat unfulfilling at the time, ultimately, the insights gained from the spirited debate helped fundamentally reshape how we view our place in the cosmos.`,

            `Although little remembered, their Great Debate a century ago hinged on a lingering uncertainty about the extent of our Milky Way and whether it constituted the entire universe or was just one of many “island universes” that we now call galaxies. Former journalist Shapley, who joked that he decided to study astronomy only because he could pronounce it, proved the Milky Way was at least 10 times bigger than previously thought.`,

But academy secretary Charles Abbot was initially skeptical, fearing that the debate would fall flat because relativity had already been “done to death” by academics and audiences wouldn’t care about island universes.`,

                Eventually, it was agreed that each speaker would get 40 minutes — hardly enough time to get warmed up, Curtis grumbled. And at 8:15 p.m. sharp on the last Monday of April 1920, the two men faced an audience of academics, members of the public, and, so the story goes, Albert Einstein.`,
            `With no audio amplification in the auditorium, Curtis’ ability to project his voice gave him an undeniable advantage. The 19-page paper Shapley presented focused mainly on the scale of the Milky Way, while Curtis’ type-written slides emphasized spiral nebulae as island universes.`,

This, combined with his underwhelming speaking abilities, probably led to Curtis being declared the winner, irrespective of the actual evidence.”`,

            `An annular eclipse occurs when the Moon is too far from Earth — or Earth is too close to the Sun — for the Moon to completely cover the Sun’s disk. The upcoming eclipse on June 21 is nearly total, and, as such, it ranks as the third_shortest annular eclipse in the remainder of the 21st century. With annularity at the eclipse’s midpoint lasting 38 seconds, only the events of May 9, 2032, and December 16, 2085, are shorter. (The annular phases of those events last 22 and 19 seconds, respectively.)`,
            `As with all near_total eclipses, an observer on the center line away from the midpoint experiences a longer annular phase because the Moon lies slightly farther away and thus appears a bit smaller. The path of this eclipse also crosses a few countries that the State Department considers less_than_totally safe. Visit www.travel.state.gov for the latest information.`,
            `Still, such considerations won’t dissuade dedicated eclipse chasers. They look forward to each chance to stand in the Moon’s shadow — or, as in this case, its anti_shadow — and to experience faraway lands in the process.`,

Inhabitants of these cities will have similar views: If they choose to stay at home, residents will experience a 93 percent partial eclipse. The largest cities in the path of annularity are Larkana and Sukkur in Sindh province.`,

That said, the northern edges of the capital city, New Delhi, with its metro area of some 26 million residents, lies within 62 miles (100 km) of the center line.`,
            `After mideclipse, the center line tracks through only 30 miles (50 km) more of India before moving into Tibet (China). Travelers wishing to view the eclipse from this region should prepare for mountainous terrain. The easiest route to the center line is by driving about 155 miles (250 km) north of the largest city in the Tibet Autonomous Region, Lhasa, along Highway G109. The same location can be reached by driving south from Nagqu along the same road. There, the event will last 40 seconds with the Sun 71° above the horizon. The best weather prospects in Tibet are for locations near Lake Manasarovar, which sits 15,060 feet (4,590 meters) above sea level.`,
            `At 7h32m32s UT, the annular phase of the eclipse begins at the Jinsha River, which marks the border between Tibet and China’s Sichuan province. Annularity there lasts 44 seconds, with the Sun 61° high at mideclipse. The antumbra leaves China at 8h11m20s UT at the port of Xiamen, a city of more than 3 million people. There, the length of annularity increases to 58 seconds while the Sun stands 35° high in the west. Unfortunately, Beijing sits well outside the path; people there will experience a 59 percent partial eclipse.`,
            `Although China, with its lengthy eclipse track and many wonderful sights, seems like an ideal place for eclipse watchers, weather prospects are not good. Due to the monsoon season, average cloud cover over much of eastern China ranges from 70 to 90 percent at this time of year.`,

          data: [
            `It’s hard to believe that nearly half the people alive today have never known a world without the Hubble Space Telescope. The space shuttle Discovery blasted off with its precious cargo from Kennedy Space Center on April 24, 1990, and the next day, the shuttle’s five_person crew deployed the school_bus_sized observatory in low Earth orbit. In the 30 years since, Hubble has helped redefine our universe, tackling problems that had plagued astronomers for decades, as well as discovering new mysteries no one imagined.`,
            `Of course, Hubble’s history has not been without glitches. The most critical appeared within weeks of its deployment. Early images revealed that the telescope’s 2.4_meter mirror was flawed — its edges were too flat by 2 micrometers, or roughly 1/50 the width of a human hair — and could not focus light sharply. For a telescope whose whole raison d’être was to deliver crystal_clear views of the cosmos from above the distorting effects of Earth’s atmosphere, the imperfection was more than disheartening.`,
            `Fortunately, NASA designed Hubble to be serviced regularly. On December 3, 1993, a team of seven astronauts rocketed into orbit aboard the space shuttle Endeavour. Their most important task: Install two new instruments that would serve as “eyeglasses” and transform fuzzy images into crystal clarity.`,
            `Four subsequent servicing missions — the final one in May 2009 — have completely revamped the observatory and made it into a 21st_century science machine. It has captured more than 1 million images of the cosmos, exploring objects as near as the Moon and as distant as some of the first galaxies to form in the early universe. And it has studied myriad examples of almost every type of target that lies between.`,

            `When people think of Hubble, most picture stunning images of Milky Way nebulae and colorful galaxies. But scientists often set their sights closer to home. No spacecraft has visited Uranus or Neptune since the 1980s, leaving Hubble and large ground_based telescopes to take up the slack. The space telescope has shown Uranus, which appeared as a bland, bluish ball when Voyager 2 flew past in 1986, to be an active world boasting bright clouds of methane. And in Neptune’s atmosphere, Hubble has tracked massive storms, some as big as Earth, propelled by winds that average 900 mph (1,450 km/h).`,
            `Hubble also has tracked storms on Jupiter and Saturn, augmenting observations made by orbiting spacecraft.

Between 2005 and 2012, the orbiting observatory discovered four new targets for New Horizons: the small moons Hydra, Nix, Kerberos, and Styx. But, more importantly, observations made over several years mapped light and dark regions on the dwarf planet’s surface. The brightest of these areas so intrigued New Horizons scientists that they targeted the flyby so it would be front and center at closest approach in July 2015. That’s how we learned so much about the heart_shaped, nitrogen_ice glacier now known as Tombaugh Regio.

            `Beyond the solar system, Hubble opened a new window into star birth and star death. Raised above Earth’s obscuring atmosphere, the space telescope collects not only visible light but also ultraviolet and infrared radiation (light with wavelengths slightly shorter and longer, respectively, than what we can see). The extra information lets scientists probe deeper into the thick clouds of gas and dust that harbor young stars.`,
            `Now astronomers can observe fledgling stars in gaseous nebulae as they emerge from their birth cocoons. They can watch the hottest of these stellar youths excavate cavities in their surroundings and erode dust_filled pillars where new stars are trying to form. In the nearby Orion Nebula, Hubble revealed protoplanetary disks surrounding dozens of baby stars. These dusty disks appear to be the raw material nature uses to create planets.`,
            `When Hubble launched, scientists counted only nine planets in the universe. (This was before Pluto’s demotion to dwarf planet status in 2006.) Since the early 1990s, astronomers have discovered more than 4,000 planets orbiting other stars. Although the space telescope contributed only a handful to this total, its spectrographs have analyzed the atmospheres of several exoplanets. Perhaps most intriguingly, Hubble has detected significant amounts of water vapor on a few of these worlds.`,
            `The lives of stars play out over millions, billions, and sometimes trillions of years, and the space telescope has given astronomers front_row seats to study nearly every stage of stellar evolution. A star like the Sun will eventually puff off its outer layers, creating a glowing death shroud known as a planetary nebula. Hubble has explored dozens of these beautiful structures and found them to be far more complex than previously suspected. Instead of exhaling one dying breath, many Sun_like stars experience multiple death throes. Intricate shapes develop as newly ejected gas interacts with material from older eruptions.`,

            `Not all stars are destined to die in relative peace. Stars that begin life with more than 8 or so solar masses exit this universe in violent supernova explosions. These titanic blasts seed the cosmos with heavy elements while leaving behind a highly compressed stellar core — either a neutron star or black hole. Hubble has studied the remnants of these explosions, tracing the elements ejected in the blasts and watching as their gaseous tendrils evolve slowly with time.`,
            `Perhaps most importantly, the space telescope has tracked the remnant developing around the site of Supernova 1987A, a super­giant star that exploded in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) — the Milky Way’s largest satellite galaxy — in February 1987. Over the past 30 years, Hubble has witnessed the supernova’s blast wave lighting up gas ejected by its progenitor star some 20,000 years earlier, and watched as the budding supernova remnant has taken shape.`,
            `The telescope’s sharp eye has roamed all over the LMC. Its investigation of the Tarantula Nebula — the largest known star_forming region in the universe — resolved one longstanding mystery about the cluster in the Tarantula’s heart. The cluster’s core, dubbed R136a, appeared to be a single star weighing 1,000 solar masses or more, far bigger than astrophysicists deem possible. But Hubble resolved the cluster’s dense core into several smaller stars. Although many tip the scale at more than 100 solar masses, making them among the heftiest stars known, they no longer violate physical law. Hubble’s LMC observations show the telescope can see objects in nearby galaxies in the same detail once possible only in the Milky Way.`,

            `As Hubble cast its eye deeper into the universe, it made one discovery after another. Perhaps none stirred the public’s imagination more than confirmation that black holes exist, and that they play vital roles in the evolution of galaxies. This signature achievement came in the 1990s, when Hubble examined the cores of M84 and M87, two of the largest galaxies in the nearby Virgo Cluster. This collection of thousands of galaxies lies some 50 million light_years from Earth. Using spectrographs to examine the rapid gas motions in the cores of these galaxies, the telescope revealed a supermassive black hole lurking at the center of each. Although earlier observations had hinted that black holes might exist in some galaxies, Hubble provided ironclad proof.`,
            `But even more importantly, Hubble found supermassive black holes to be common. Essentially every galaxy that possesses a dense, spherical bulge of stars surrounding its center hosts one of these beasts. These black holes range in size from perhaps 100,000 solar masses in dwarf galaxies to several billion solar masses in the biggest island universes. Hubble also showed that a black hole and its host galaxy are intimately linked: The masses of the stellar bulge and black hole grow in tandem.`,
            `Of course, Hubble doesn’t restrict its gaze to the hearts of galaxies. It routinely explores individual stars known as Cepheid variables in nearby galaxies to pin down the expansion rate of the universe. Known as the Hubble constant after American astronomer Edwin Hubble, who discovered this expansion and for whom the space telescope is named, the rate plays a fundamental role in cosmology.`,
            `Cepheids serve as a critical rung on the cosmic distance ladder because the period of their pulsations tracks with their intrinsic luminosity. Observe how bright one appears in the sky and you can calculate how far away it is. Then measure how fast its host galaxy recedes from Earth and you get the expansion rate. Thirty years of Hubble observations have pinpointed the expansion rate at 73 kilometers per second per megaparsec (one megaparsec equals 3.26 million light_years). Oddly enough, measurements from the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite give a value of 67, and scientists have yet to figure out how to bridge the gap. (See “Tension at the heart of cosmology” in the June 2019 issue.)`,
            `When the space telescope looks at galaxies in full, it usually finds a neighbor or two. In fact, Hubble has shown that collisions between galaxies are more the rule than the exception. Some of these collisions are in their early stages. For example, the Whirlpool Galaxy and its companion, NGC 5195, show only subtle traces of an initial interaction. Others, such as the Mice, display the distorted shapes and long tidal tails that develop as gravity acts over longer periods of time. And still others, exemplified by the Antennae galaxies, are experiencing a full_blown impact. Here, the galaxies have lost much of their individual identities as gas clouds ram into one another and trigger a maelstrom of star birth.`,
            `Speaking of galaxy collisions, Hubble has verified that the Milky Way is not immune. Detailed observations of our large neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy, show that it is on a collision course with our galaxy and will not merely pass closely. Over the next several billion years, these two behemoths will act out the same scenes now being performed by the Mice and Antennae.`,

Over the past several decades, new types of precise measurements have allowed scientists to scrutinize and refine this account, letting them reconstruct the history of our universe in ever greater detail. When we compare the results from different kinds of measurements — the expansion rate of the universe, the temperature patterns in the light released when the first atoms formed, the abundances of various chemical elements, and the distribution of galaxies and other large_scale structures — we find stunning agreement. Each of these lines of evidence supports the conclusion that our universe expanded and evolved in just the way that the Big Bang theory predicts. From this perspective, our universe appears to be remarkably comprehensible.`,

And in order to make sense of the universe as we observe it, cosmologists have been forced to conclude that space, during its earliest moments, must have undergone a brief and spectacular period of hyperfast expansion — an event known as cosmic inflation. Yet we know next to nothing about this key era of cosmic history.`,
            `It’s possible that these puzzles are little more than loose ends, each of which will be resolved as cosmologists continue to investigate our universe. But so far, these problems have proven to be remarkably stubborn and persistent. With the goal of identifying the individual particles that make up dark matter, scientists have designed and built a series of impressive experiments — yet no such particles have appeared. Even powerful particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider have revealed nothing that moves us closer to resolving any of these cosmic mysteries. And despite having measured the expansion history and large_scale structure of the universe in ever increasing detail, we have not gained any substantively greater understanding of the nature of dark energy, the force that seems to be accelerating the expansion of the cosmos.`,
            `It is from this perspective that some cosmologists have found themselves asking whether these cosmic mysteries might be symptoms of something more significant than a few loose threads. Perhaps these puzzles are not as unrelated as they might seem, but are instead collectively pointing us toward a very different picture of our universe and its earliest moments.`,

            `Dark matter is likely the most celebrated problem facing modern cosmologists. Astronomers have determined that most of the matter in our universe does not consist of atoms or any other known substances, but of something else — something that does not appreciably radiate, reflect, or absorb light.`,
            `Despite not knowing much about the nature of dark matter, cosmologists often speculate about the kinds of particles that might make up this substance. In particular, researchers have long recognized that if dark matter particles interact through a force that is approximately as powerful as the weak nuclear force (which governs radioactive decay), then the number of these particles that should have emerged from the Big Bang would roughly match the measured abundance of dark matter found in the universe today. With this in mind, weakly interacting massive particles — WIMPs — became the best guess for dark matter’s nature.`,
            `MPs was that scientists thought they knew how to detect the particles and study their properties. Motivated by this goal, physicists engaged in an ambitious experimental program to identify these WIMPs and learn how they were forged in the Big Bang. Over the past couple of decades, researchers have deployed a succession of increasingly sensitive dark matter detectors in deep_underground laboratories that are capable of detecting individual collisions between a dark matter particle and the atoms that make up the target.`,
            `These sophisticated experiments performed beautifully — as well as or better than designed. Yet no such collisions have been observed. A decade ago, many scientists were optimistic that these experiments would bear fruit. But dark matter has turned out to be very different, and far more elusive, than we had once imagined.`,
            `Although it’s still possible that dark matter could consist of some form of difficult_to_detect WIMPs, the lack of any signal from underground experiments has led many physicists to shift their focus toward other dark matter candidates. One such contender is a hypothetical ultralight particle known as an axion. Axions are predicted according to a theory proposed by particle physicists Roberto Peccei and Helen Quinn in 1977. Although scientists are searching for axions in experiments that use powerful magnetic fields to convert them into photons, these investigations have yet to place very strict constraints on the properties of these particles.`,
            `Another possibility that could explain why dark matter has been so difficult to detect is that the first moments of the universe may have played out much differently than cosmologists have long imagined. Take the case of the conventional WIMP. Calculations show that the fledgling universe should have produced vast quantities of these particles during the first millionth of a second or so after the Big Bang, when they reached a state of equilibrium with the surrounding plasma of quarks, gluons, and other subatomic particles. The number of WIMPs that could have survived these conditions — and ultimately contributed to the dark matter found throughout today’s universe — depends on how, and how often, they interacted. But when carrying out calculations such as these, scientists generally assume that space expanded steadily during the first fraction of a second, without any unexpected events or transitions. It is entirely plausible that this simply was not the case.`,
            `Although cosmologists know a great deal about how our universe expanded and evolved over most of its history, they know relatively little about the first seconds that followed the Big Bang — and next to nothing about the first trillionth of a second. When it comes to how our universe may have evolved, or to the events that may have taken place during these earliest moments, we have essentially no direct observations on which to rely. This era is hidden from view, buried beneath impenetrable layers of energy, distance, and time.`,
            `Our understanding of this period of cosmic history is, in many respects, little more than an informed guess based on inference and extrapolation. Look far enough back in time, and almost everything we know about our universe could have been different. Matter and energy existed in different forms than they do today, and they may have experienced forces that have not yet been discovered. Key events and transitions may have taken place that science has yet to illuminate. Matter likely interacted in ways that it no longer does, and space and time themselves may have behaved differently than they do in the world we know.`,

            `In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving away from us at speeds proportional to their distances. This provided the first clear evidence that our universe is expanding. Ever since, the current rate of this expansion — the Hubble constant — has been one of the key properties of our universe that cosmologists study.`,
            `It’s fair to say that the Hubble constant has long been difficult to measure. Hubble’s original determination was plagued with systematic errors that led him to overestimate the expansion rate by a factor of 7. As recently as the 1990s, textbooks often quoted values ranging from as low as 50 to as high as 100 kilometers per second for every million parsecs separating two points in space — usually written as 50 to 100 km/s/Mpc. (One megaparsec [Mpc] equals 3.26 million light_years.) Although the precision of these measurements has improved considerably over the past two decades, no consensus yet exists regarding the correct value for this quantity. In fact, as these measurements have improved, the results from different methods seem to disagree with one another even more.`,
            `One way to determine the Hubble constant is to directly measure how fast objects are moving away from us, just as Hubble did in 1929. For his measurements, Hubble used a special class of pulsating stars known as Cepheid variables, whose intrinsic luminosities track nicely with the periods over which they brighten and fade. Modern cosmologists continue to use Cepheids for this purpose, but they also employ other classes of objects, including type Ia supernovae — exploding white dwarfs that all have the same approximate luminosity. When researchers combine the latest data, they find that the universe is currently expanding at a rate of about 72 to 76 km/s/Mpc.`,
            `But that’s not the end of the story. Cosmologists also can infer the value of the Hubble constant by studying the primordial light released when the first atoms formed some 380,000 years after the Big Bang. The detailed temperature patterns of this light — known as the cosmic microwave background — serve as a map that shows how matter was distributed throughout the universe at that time.`,
            `When scrutinized, this map reveals many details about our young universe, including how much matter and other forms of energy were present, as well as how fast space was expanding. It also tells us that the Hubble constant is about 67 km/s/Mpc — a significantly smaller value than cosmologists have found through more direct measurements.`,
            `What does this mismatch mean for our universe? Assuming that these studies have correctly accounted for all the systematic uncertainties inherent in the observations, these two ways of determining the Hubble constant appear to be incompatible — at least within the context of the standard cosmological model. To make these discrepant results mutually consistent, astronomers would be forced to change how we think the cosmos expanded and evolved, or to reconsider the forms of matter and energy in the universe during the first few hundred thousand years following the Big Bang.`,
            `According to Einstein’s general theory of relativity, the rate at which space expands depends on the density of matter and other forms of energy it contains. When cosmologists infer the value of the Hubble constant from the cosmic microwave background, they have to make assumptions about the amounts of dark matter, neutrinos, and other substances that were present.`,

But lately, it seems the more we study the universe, the less we understand it. Despite decades of effort, the nature of dark matter remains unknown, and the problem of dark energy seems nearly intractable. We do not know how the particles that make up the atoms in our universe managed to survive the first moments of the Big Bang, and we still know little about cosmic inflation, how it played out, or how it came to an end — assuming that something like inflation happened at all.`,
            `It is from this perspective that I sometimes find myself considering whether these mysteries might represent something greater than a few open and unrelated questions. Perhaps they are telling us that the earliest moments of our universe were far different from what we long imagined them to be. Perhaps these problems represent the beginning of a revolution for the science of cosmology.`,
            `Sometimes I wonder whether we might be on a significant precipice of scientific history, similar to what we experienced in 1904. At that time, physics had never before seemed to be on such solid footing. For more than two centuries, the principles of Newtonian physics had been applied successfully to problem after problem. And although physicists expanded their knowledge into areas such as electricity, magnetism, and heat, these aspects of the world were really not so different from those Newton had described hundreds of years earlier. To the physicists of 1904, the world seemed well understood. There was little reason to expect a revolution.`,
            `Similar to the situation cosmologists confront today, however, the physicists of 1904 had not yet been able to address a few challenges. The medium through which they believed light traveled — the luminiferous ether — should have induced variations in the speed of light, and yet light always moves through space at the same rate. Astronomers observed the orbit of Mercury to be slightly different from what Newtonian physics predicted, leading some to suggest that an unknown planet, dubbed Vulcan, might be perturbing Mercury’s trajectory.`,

These include a thermal imager (THEMIS), a gamma ray spectrometer (GRS), and a high_gain antenna that helps martian rovers and landers communicate with Earth.",
          data: [
            `When NASA’s Odyssey spacecraft blasted off in 2001, Mars was considered a dry, barren world. But over the past two decades, this quiet powerhouse of an orbiter has revealed a wealth of information about the Red Planet. During its first year around Mars, Odyssey found the first direct evidence of subsurface water on the planet. The orbiter also currently holds the record for the longest continuous observations of martian weather, which is an ongoing study with important implications for future human habitation of Mars.`,
            `Twenty years of wear and tear have undoubtedly taken their toll on the plucky robotic craft. In fact, a series of strong solar flares put one instrument out of commission in 2003, just a few years after blasting off for the Red Planet. And, in 2012, the spacecraft lost one of four reaction wheels, which are responsible for controlling its orientation (though the three remaining wheels continue to function).`,
            `While Odyssey is nevertheless managing to still carry out its job in space, it’s struggling in the political arena. President Trump’s 2021 budget request, released in February 2020, most clearly threatened missions like SOFIA, a telescope that flies on a plane. However, the danger to Odyssey was more subtle: Trump’s 2021 budget slashes Odyssey’s funding from just under $12 million to around $1 million. This would effectively pull the plug on a working spacecraft, whose primary costs are human maintenance and guidance.`,
            `But “Odyssey is remarkably healthy,” says Phil Christensen, the principal investigator for Odyssey’s Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) and a geologist at Arizona State University. “It’s just this crazy workhorse spacecraft that rarely goes into safe mode.”`,

          data: [
            `Odyssey arrived at Mars on October 24, 2001, with the goal of investigating the martian environment. The spacecraft was designed to map the planet’s chemical and mineralogical makeup as a step toward understanding the role water played in shaping the environment, both past and present. The orbiter completed its primary mission in August 2004, then began to take on a series of two_year mission extensions, each dedicated to a specific set of objectives.`,
            `“Odyssey has played a pivotal role in changing how we think about Mars,” says Lori Glaze, NASA’s Planetary Science Division director. “It has really changed our perception of a planet that [we thought] was a dry desert to one that’s a frozen desert.”`,
            `Odyssey carried three main science instruments to the Red Planet: THEMIS, the Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), and the Mars Radiation Environment Experiment (MARIE). THEMIS is still active today, working to map the distribution of minerals on Mars’ surface by scanning it in visible and infrared light. Martian minerals that are heated by the Sun radiate that heat back into space, allowing THEMIS to chart the planet’s mineralogical makeup at night. GRS, also still active, has a similar job: mapping chemicals by monitoring gamma rays produced when cosmic rays strike the martian surface. This technique allowed GRS to play a key role in discovering water ice locked just below the ground in 2002. MARIE’s job was characterizing the radiation environment of space around Mars. However, MARIE shut down in 2003, after charged particles from the Sun bombarded the spacecraft, irrevocably damaging the instrument.`,
            `Although Odyssey made an initial splash by finding signs of ice beneath Mars’ surface, it didn’t stop there; the craft also uncovered snowpacks in some of the planet’s warmer regions. These snowpacks, potentially remnants from a martian ice age, provided some of the first hints that Mars is experiencing ongoing climate change.`,
            `“There’s a lot of ice on Mars,” Christensen says, pointing out that in some places it can lie as deep as 10 inches (25 centimeters) beneath the surface. “That’s going to be extremely important when we send humans to Mars, using that water ice.” Mining ice could potentially provide the liquid water that humans need to survive, without having to lug it from Earth.`,
            `This potential for in situ resource utilization — using what materials are locally available — is an important factor in selecting future human landing sites on Mars. A 2019 paper published in Geophysical Research Letters used data from Odyssey and its sister craft, the Mars Research Orbiter, to look for ice that could easily be dug up by intrepid human explorers. “You wouldn’t need a backhoe to dig up this ice. You could use a shovel,” the paper’s lead author, Sylvain Piqueux of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), said in a press release. “We’re continuing to collect data on buried ice on Mars, zeroing in on the best places for astronauts to land.”`,

            `While Odyssey has pumped out a significant amount of science during its lifetime, it has also served as valuable support for other missions. Odyssey has helped researchers select the landing sites for the Opportunity rover, the InSight lander, and the Perseverance rover; plus, the orbiter provided confirmation that Curiosity had pulled off its unique sky crane landing maneuver. And in 2010, when the Phoenix Mars Lander suffered through a chilling martian winter it wasn’t designed to survive, Odyssey spent several periods of time listening for hints that the lander had come back to life following the return of springtime sunlight.`,
            `The orbiter also serves as a communications hub, a role that began in 2004 with Spirit, Opportunity, and Phoenix, and continues with Curiosity and InSight. Plaut says that Odyssey broadcast a “large majority” of the science data collected by Spirit and Opportunity over their seven_ and 15_year mission lifetimes, respectively. According to Plaut, InSight currently uses Odyssey for relaying most of its data and almost all its commands. In total, Odyssey communicates with rovers or landers multiple times almost every day, says Plaut.`,
            `With its 20_year anniversary on the horizon, the spacecraft is still far from finished with its science. “We have a number of ongoing science investigations, primarily with the THEMIS infrared and visible camera,” Plaut says. Those include observations of the martian atmosphere early in the morning and just after sunset, which could provide “unique information on the patterns of weather and climate that are not available to other orbiters,” he say`,
            `Although THEMIS has helped researchers to make great discoveries, mapping the martian surface isn’t a new job description. On the other hand, the now_defunct MARIE was the first experiment specifically sent to Mars to prepare for an eventual human presence. Unfortunately for future martians, MARIE found that radiation levels from solar flares and cosmic rays are two to three times higher on the Red Planet than on Earth. That’s because Earth is protected by our planet’s hardy magnetosphere and thick atmosphere, which Mars lacks. That’s not ideal, but it is vital environmental information to know.`,

And as other missions arrive at the Red Planet, Odyssey remains in a position to help solve questions that have not yet been asked.

In July, the House of Representatives passed its Commerce_Justice_Science Funding Bill, which echoed the president’s numbers for NASA’s missions and left Odyssey at the shutdown level.`,
            `The next step is for the Senate to pass its own bill. But people familiar with the budget process say that’s unlikely to happen until after the 2020 presidential election in November — even though the new budget is supposed to kick off in October, the start of the 2021 fiscal year. After the passage of the Senate’s bill, the Senate and House of Representatives will come together to resolve their differences before voting on the newly drafted budget. Finally, after it passes, the president will sign the bill.Right now, Odyssey doesn’t seem to have anyone advocating for it. NASA isn’t requesting an increased budget and no legislator seems particularly disturbed by the loss of the mission. It’s possible that a public groundswell of support could make a change, but the mission’s potential demise hasn’t attracted a lot of attention.`,
            `If nothing changes with Trump’s proposed budget — and Odyssey’s funding is slashed — mission controllers would likely have no choice but to permanently shut down the craft. However, the exact process for shutting down Odyssey isn’t publicly available, and Freedom of Information Act requests filed by Astronomy have been delayed, due, in part, to the COVID_19 pandemic. Still, Odyssey’s end has essentially been planned since launch.`,
            `“Whether it’s financial need to [shut down], or it reaches its end of [its] life, at some point, with a 20_year_old orbiter, you need to plan for these things,” Glaze says. “We’ve been planning this for a long time.”`,
            `According to that plan, mission controllers would turn off Odyssey’s science instruments and verify its orbit. Finally, they would tell Odyssey to dump its fuel, and sign off. Listless and silent, Odyssey would drift around Mars, its orbit decaying over the decades, until it eventually crashes down on the same martian surface that it so meticulously mapped.`,
            `Odyssey’s budgetary shakedown is part of a broader realignment of NASA’s Mars exploration strategy that focuses on bringing back samples from Mars — something for which scientists have been advocating for decades.`,

There is precedent: In 2010, a class of seventh graders in California taking part in Arizona State University’s educational program discovered a martian lava tube with a skylight. After closely studying more than 200 THEMIS images of Mars, the students were then eligible to request Odyssey take a targeted image of their site. “If Odyssey just became a student camera, I think it would be worth the money to keep it,” Christensen says. “I’m a long way from giving up on this mission.”`,
